Description

Multi Draggable provides live and multi element draggable functionality to jQuery UI Draggable. 


Usage:

1. Can you used same way as you do for Draggable. In addition, you can add "group" option as a jquery object or selector, which determines which group of elements to be dragged together.

Ex 1:  $(".className").multiDraggable({ group: $(.className)});

In the above case, dragging any element that matches .className , drags all elements matching .className to drag together.

Ex 2:  $("#drag1").multiDraggable({ group: [$("#drag1"),$("#drag2") ]});

In this case, dragging #drag1, makes #drag2 drag along with it, even though #drag2 is not draggable.

Ex 3: (".className").multiDraggable({ 
                      group: $(.className),
                      startNative: function (event,ui) {},
                      stopNative : function (event,ui) {},
                      dragNative : function (event,ui) {}
                      });
                      
Ex 3: (".className").multiDraggable({ group: ".className" });

In this case , by parsing in a jquery selector string will drag the dom object that have the classs name when user start to drag.

You can use all events, options and methods of jQuery UI Draggable, except that
  -'start' is now 'startNative'
  -'drag' is now 'dragNative'
  -'stop' is now 'stopNative'
  - everything else remains the same.
